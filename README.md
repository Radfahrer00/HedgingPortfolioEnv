# HedgingPortfolioEnv
This repository was used in the context of the bachelor thesis with the title "A Risk-Sensitive Approach for modeling the Hedging Portfolio Problem 
with Reinforcement Learning".

Based on the TradingEnv and the StocksEnv, a new OpenAI Gym environment, called HedgingPortoflioEnv, was created.

For Reinforcement Learning training purposes, a simple implementation of the DQN algorithm was used.
